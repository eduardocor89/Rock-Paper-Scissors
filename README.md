# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a work in progress and somehow I've made it nearly impossible to win against the computer. 

This simple rock paper scissors game was part of a school project. It's playable and fun if you wanna impress your nieces and nephews. 


To be added in the future:
1. Mimmicking option for the computer to play your last move
2. Last move OR a random move
3. HOW ABOUT A PAPER SCISSORS LIZARD SPOCK VERSION!?!
